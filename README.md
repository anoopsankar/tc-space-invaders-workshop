This is the code that I presented during the live coding session.

I've refactored it a little bit; but nothing major. 

I've also added a simple Game Over screen and how to restart the game as well; since that was a question.

All the assets are available as well.

To run this; install Godot and import the godot.project file into the IDE.

Enjoy!
